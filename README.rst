What is it?
-----------
So, at this moment this is just a couple lines of code. What I like to have here in the future is the XBuild/MSBuild task to enables you to compile C code on Linux, Windows or Mac. So, for example, if you have C# project that uses native binaries, you can compile it within xbuild. Naturally build will be done using all your cores and only rebuilding what has changed since last build. That's all ;)

Licence
-------
The project uses the MIT licence as you can tell from the source code.
